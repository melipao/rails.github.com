          <strong>David Heinemeier Hansson</strong> extracted Ruby on Rails from his
          work on <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com" title="Click to go to Basecamp page">Basecamp</a>. He released the
          framework as open source in July of 2004, but didn’t share the commit rights
          until February of 2005. He’s infamous for his ruthless delegation, which is
          often executed as a request to “Please Do Investigate”. He’s a partner at
          <a href="http://www.bascamp.com" title="Click to go to Basecamp page">Basecamp</a>, his personal page is

          Hot on the heels of DHH, he has been the most active contributor to Rails. He’s knee deep
